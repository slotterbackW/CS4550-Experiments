# CS4550 Final Project Experiments
Team 3: Charlie Peters (GitHub: chpeters) and Will Slotterback
Project: Cryptocurrency Tracker

This repository contains three functionality experiments for our CS4550 Web Development final project. The experiments are meant to be a proof of concept for functionality we will include in our final project. Currently our three experiments are: 
#### Warning: ðŸš§ Work In Progress ðŸš§ This list is subject to change.
1. Connecting to the coinbase API to authenticate users and integrate their existing coinbase wallets
2. Connecting to CryptoCompare's websocket to pull realtime cryptocurrency prices, and fixer.io for international exchange rates, and then looking for opportunities for arbitration between the two.
3. Rendering some sort of data visualization for a static set of this data in the browser.

Below you can also find a more detailed description of each experiment as well as our original project proposal for more information.

### Project Proposal
For our project we will be building a web application which users can use to track cryptocurrency prices for different cryptocurrencies. Users will also be able to track the exchange rate for cryptocurrencies to international currencies. Users can create an account and select cryptocurrency exchanges to track and those exchange prices will be shown in real time in the user's dashboard.

We'll be using CryptoCompare's websocket to get real time cryptocurrency prices, and their api to integrate cryptocurrency exchange prices. We'll also be using fixer.io's api to get the exchange rate for international currencies.

As a stretch goal we'd love to also integrate with coinbase or some other cryptocurrency wallet to allow users to place trades, and shapeshift.io to let users easily convert between cryptocurrencies. We think this, however, may be outside of the scope of this project, but it would be a nice to have.
